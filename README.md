# SVHN_recognition
SVHN Dataset Digit Recognition

This is the Capstone Project of Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree.
The main goal is to recognize the single digit of [SVHN (Street View House Number)](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) dataset provided by Stanford University.

If you want to run the code in ```code``` folder, you will have to 
> 1) Download cropped ```train_32x32.mat``` and ```test_32x32.mat``` dataset and put them in ```data``` folder.
>
> 2) Install ```Python 2.7```, ```NumPy```, ```SciPy```, ```Matplotlib``` and ```Tensorflow```.

You can adjust the hyper-parameter in corresponding blocks and the directory of output model file and statistic file if you like.
